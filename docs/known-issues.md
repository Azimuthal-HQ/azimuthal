Documented by Agent 2E (Integration Validator) after validating Phases 0-2.

## 1. ~~Missing Repository Adapter Layer~~ (RESOLVED)

**Severity**: High
**Status**: Resolved — implemented in `internal/db/adapters/` by Agent 2F

The domain services (auth, tickets, projects) define repository interfaces using domain types (e.g., `auth.User`, `tickets.Ticket`, `projects.Item`), and the data layer has sqlc-generated queries using DB types (e.g., `generated.User`, `generated.Item`). There is no adapter code bridging these two layers.

**Impact**: The binary serves health/ready endpoints but cannot serve the full API routes because the chi router (`api.NewRouter`) requires service instances, which require repository implementations.

**Design mismatches to resolve**:
- `auth.User` has no `OrgID` field, but `generated.User` and `CreateUserParams` require one
- `auth.SessionRepository.GetByToken` accepts a plain token, but `generated.GetSessionByTokenHash` expects a hashed value
- `generated.GetUserByEmail` requires `OrgID` parameter, but `auth.UserRepository.GetByEmail` takes only email
- Domain types use `time.Time`, `*uuid.UUID`; generated types use `pgtype.Timestamptz`, `pgtype.UUID`

**Note**: The wiki `PageStore` interface uses generated types directly, so `*generated.Queries` already satisfies it. Only auth, tickets, and projects modules need adapters.

**Resolution**: Created `internal/db/adapters/` package with `UserAdapter`, `SessionAdapter`, `TicketAdapter`, `ItemAdapter`, `SprintAdapter`, `RelationAdapter`, and `LabelAdapter`. The OrgID mismatch is resolved by injecting a default org ID at the adapter boundary. The token hashing mismatch is resolved by SHA-256 hashing plain tokens in `SessionAdapter` before calling `GetSessionByTokenHash`. The `GetByEmail` signature mismatch is resolved by the adapter injecting the configured OrgID into the `GetUserByEmailParams`.

## 2. Test Coverage Below 60% Floor (47.1%)

**Severity**: Medium
**Status**: Needs additional tests

Overall statement coverage is 47.1%. Lowest-coverage packages:

| Package | Coverage |
|---|---|
| `internal/db` | 1.8% |
| `internal/jobs` | 34.4% |
| `internal/core/api/projects` | 35.8% |
| `internal/core/api/tickets` | 40.8% |
| `internal/core/api/spaces` | 41.5% |
| `internal/core/api/wiki` | 47.0% |
| `cmd/server` | 0.0% |
| `internal/db/generated` | 0.0% (generated code) |

The DB and generated packages are integration-test only (require real Postgres). API handler sub-packages have partial test coverage.

## 3. Race Detector Requires CGO (Windows CI)

**Severity**: Low
**Status**: Environment constraint

`go test -race ./...` requires `CGO_ENABLED=1` and a C compiler (GCC). On Windows without GCC installed, race detection cannot run locally. The CI pipeline (Linux-based) should handle this. Ensure the CI runner has GCC available.

## 4. Soft-Delete Missing on Some Tables

**Severity**: Low
**Status**: Design review needed

The following tables lack `deleted_at` columns:
- `memberships` — may need audit trail for membership removal
- `space_members` — same concern
- `sprints` — sprint history could be useful for reporting

These may be intentional design choices (ephemeral data), but should be reviewed before GA.

## 5. ~~cmd/server/main.go Does Not Wire Full API Router~~ (RESOLVED)

**Severity**: High (related to issue #1)
**Status**: Resolved — `cmd/server/main.go` now wires the full API router (Agent 2F)

`cmd/server/main.go` now:
1. Connects to the database via `db.Connect()`
2. Runs migrations via `db.Migrate()`
3. Bootstraps a default organisation
4. Constructs all services with DB-backed adapters from `internal/db/adapters/`
5. Calls `api.NewRouter()` with the full `RouterConfig`

All API routes (auth, tickets, wiki, projects, spaces) are served alongside health/ready.
